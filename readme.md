# freeCodeCamp Local Weather App

This is my personal implementation of the freeCodeCamp Local Weather Intermediate challenge.

You can access the app in its current state at:
https://alaskaa.github.io/fcc-weather-app

The app can be accessed on desktop or mobile without any problems. The app displays the current time, takes the user's current location and returns an icon based on the user's current weather and temperature in their location. You can also toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

The weather icons I used in this app have been created by Erik Flowers which you can find [here](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/).
